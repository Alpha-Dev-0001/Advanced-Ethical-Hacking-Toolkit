# Usage Examples:
# Port Scanner
scanner = PortScanner("192.168.1.1", range(1, 1000), 50)
result = scanner.run_scan()

# Vulnerability Scanner
vuln_scanner = VulnerabilityScanner("http://example.com")
vulnerabilities = vuln_scanner.run_scan()

# Password Cracker
cracker = PasswordCracker("5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99", "wordlist.txt", "md5")
result = cracker.crack()
